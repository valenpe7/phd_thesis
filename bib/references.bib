abstract = {A quantum theory of the scattering of X-rays and -rays by light elements.The hypothesis is suggested that when an X-ray quantum is scattered it spends all of its energy and momentum upon some particular electron. This electron in turn scatters the ray in some definite direction. The change in momentum of the X-ray quantum due to the change in its direction of propagation results in a recoil of the scattering electron. The energy in the scattered quantum is thus less than the energy in the primary quantum by the kinetic energy of recoil of the scattering electron. The corresponding increase in the wave-length of the scattered beam is -0=(2hmc) sin2 12=0.0484 sin2 12, where h is the Planck constant, m is the mass of the scattering electron, c is the velocity of light, and is the angle between the incident and the scattered ray. Hence the increase is independent of the wave-length. The distribution of the scattered radiation is found, by an indirect and not quite rigid method, to be concentrated in the forward direction according to a definite law (Eq. 27). The total energy removed from the primary beam comes out less than that given by the classical Thomson theory in the ratio 1(1+2±), where ±=hmc0=0.02420. Of this energy a fraction (1+±)(1+2) reappears as scattered radiation, while the remainder is truly absorbed and transformed into kinetic energy of recoil of the scattering electrons. Hence, if 0 is the scattering absorption coefficient according to the classical theory, the coefficient according to this theory is =0(1+2±)=s+a, where s is the true scattering coefficient [(1+±)(1+2±)2], and a is the coefficient of absorption due to scattering [±(1+2±)2]. Unpublished experimental results are given which show that for graphite and the Mo-K radiation the scattered radiation is longer than the primary, the observed difference (2-0=.022) being close to the computed value.024. In the case of scattered -rays, the wave-length has been found to vary with in agreement with the theory, increasing from.022 A (primary) to.068 A (=135). Also the velocity of secondary -rays excited in light elements by -rays agrees with the suggestion that they are recoil electrons. As for the predicted variation of absorption with Hewlett's results for carbon for wave-lengths below 0.5 A are in excellent agreement with this theory; also the predicted concentration in the forward direction is shown to be in agreement with the experimental results, both for X-rays and -rays. This remarkable agreement between experiment and theory indicates clearly that scattering is a quantum phenomenon and can be explained without introducing any new hypothesis as to the size of the electron or any new constants; also that a radiation quantum carries with it momentum as well as energy. The restriction to light elements is due to the assumption that the constraining forces acting on the scattering electrons are negligible, which is probably legitimate only for the lighter elements. Spectrum of K-rays from Mo scattered by graphite, as compared with the spectrum of the primary rays, is given in Fig. 4, showing the change of wave-length.

@article{Schwinger1949,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the properties of the radiation from a high energy accelerated electron, as recently observed in the General Electric synchrotron. An elementary derivation of the total rate of radiation is first presented, based on Larmor's formula for a slowly moving electron, and arguments of relativistic invariance. We then construct an expression for the instantaneous power radiated by an electron moving along an arbitrary, prescribed path. By casting this result into various forms, one obtains the angular distribution, the spectral distribution, or the combined angular and spectral distributions of the radiation. The method is based on an examination of the rate at which the electron irreversibly transfers energy to the electromagnetic field, as determined by half the difference of retarded and advanced electric field intensities. Formulas are obtained for an arbitrary charge-current distribution and then specialized to a point charge. The total radiated power and its angular distribution are obtained for an arbitrary trajectory. It is found that the direction of motion is a strongly preferred direction of emission at high energies. The spectral distribution of the radiation depends upon the detailed motion over a time interval large compared to the period of the radiation. However, the narrow cone of radiation generated by an energetic electron indicates that only a small part of the trajectory is effective in producing radiation observed in a given direction, which also implies that very high frequencies are emitted. Accordingly, we evaluate the spectral and angular distributions of the high frequency radiation by an energetic electron, in their dependence upon the parameters characterizing the instantaneous orbit. The average spectral distribution, as observed in the synchrotron measurements, is obtained by averaging the electron energy over an acceleration cycle. The entire spectrum emitted by an electron moving with constant speed in a circular path is also discussed. Finally, it is observed that quantum effects will modify the classical results here obtained only at extraordinarily large energies. {\textcopyright} 1949 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Investigations of nonlinear electron oscillations in a cold plasma where the thermal motions may be neglected indicate that except for the simplest one-dimensional situation such oscillations will destroy themselves through the development of multistream flow. It is found possible to give an exact analysis of oscillations with plane, cylindrical, and spherical symmetry. Plane oscillations in a uniform plasma are found to be stable below a critical amplitude. For larger amplitudes it is found that multistream flow or fine-scale mixing sets in on the first oscillation. Oscillations with spherical or cylindrical symmetry develop multistream flow almost always, independent of the amplitude. The time required for mixing to start is inversely proportional to the square of the amplitude. Plane oscillations in a nonuniform plasma are also found to exhibit this type of behavior. Some considerations are also given to more general oscillations and a calculation is presented which indicates that multistream flow will usually set in. {\textcopyright} 1959 The American Physical Society.},

Thus, for sufficiently small subtended solid angle, an object will appear-optically-the same shape to all observers. A sphere will photograph with precisely the same circular outline whether stationary or in motion with respect to the camera. An object of less symmetry than a sphere, such as a meter stick, will appear, when in rapid motion with respect to an observer, to have undergone rotation, not contraction. The extent of this rotation is given by the aberration angle ($\theta$-$\theta$′), in which $\theta$ is the angle at which the object is seen by the observer and $\theta$′ is the angle at which the object would be seen by another observer at the same point stationary with respect to the object. Observers photographing the meter stick simultaneously from the same position will obtain precisely the same picture, except for a change in scale given by the Doppler shift ratio, irrespective of their velocity relative to the meter stick. Even if methods of measuring distance, such as stereoscopic photography, are used, the Lorentz contraction will not be visible, although correction for the finite velocity of light will reveal it to be present. {\textcopyright} 1959 The American Physical Society.},

For plasma temperatures of 3 up to 10 keV the total radiation output will range from 6 down to 2 times that of plasma bremsstrahlung alone. The conversion efficiency is relatively insensitive to the laser frequency and to the plasma temperature, and amounts to 2%-5%.

abstract = {This book contains the Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on the Numerical Simu- lation of Plasmas held at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. on the 2nd and 3rd of November 1970. The conferences on the Numerical Simulation of Plasmas were used in the past to disseminate progress in the state-of-the-art of plasma simula- tion and specific applications of computer experiments to plasma physics. The first conference was held in 1967 at the College of William and Mary; the second was held in 1968 at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and the third at Stanford University in 1969. At the time of the Fourth Conference, the field reached a highly sophisticated degree of maturity and won the acceptance of the general Plasma Physics Community. The number of presentations related to plasma simulation at APS Meetings of the Plasma Physics Division has been exponential since 1963. Eight percent of the total papers presented at the 1970 APS Meeting were in the field of numerical simulation. Most of these papers were oriented toward the application of numerical methods to the solution and understanding of physical phenomena. Therefore, the decision was taken at the Third Simulation Conference at Stanford to restrict the papers presented at the Fourth Conference to numerical techniques rather than the application of such techniques to plasma physics. It was further decided that the papers should be more comprehensive even though this would reduce the number of papers which could be presented orally at a two-day conference. The selection of papers for oral presentation at the Conference was based on the detailed, extended abstracts submitted by the authors. These extended abstracts provided the basis for evaluating proposed presentations in light of the two objectives of the Conference. The ultimate objective of the Conference was to present the state-of-the-art to which plasma simulation has evolved. An auxiliary goal was to make available to the general community a set of proceedings encompassing all aspects of the field and providing the researcher with a working reference and the graduate student with guidelines in this area of research.},

abstract = {The self‐focusing of relativistically intense laser light pulses is analyzed, where the pulse length is short enough that ion inertia prevents any significant motion of ions. Self‐focusing occurs as a result of an increase of the wave refractive index arising from two effects: the mass increase of electrons caused by their relativistic quiver velocity in the light wave, and the reduction of the electron density as a result of ponderomotive force expulsion of the electrons. The latter effect is significant even for rather small values of (P−P L )/P L , where P is the laser beam power and P L is the critical power above which self‐focusing occurs. In fact, for (P−P L )/P L ≳0.1 the effect is so strong that a l l electrons are expelled within a core radial region of the self‐focused laser light channel (this new phenomenon is called e l e c t r o n c a v i t a t i o n).},

abstract = {Diode laser-pumped solid-state lasers are efficient, compact, all solid-state sources of coherent optical radiation. Major advances in solid-state laser technology have historically been preceded by advances in pumping technology. The helical flash lamps used to pump early ruby lasers were superseded by the linear flash lamp and arc lamp now used to pump neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet lasers. The latest advance in pumping technology is the diode laser. Diode laser-pumped neodymium users have operated at greater than 10 percent electrical to optical efficiency in a single spatial mode and with linewidths of less than 10 kilohertz. The high spectral power brightness of these lasers has allowed frequency extension by harmonic generation in nonlinear crystals, which has led to green and blue sources of coherent radiation. Diode laser pumping has also been used with ions other than neodymhim to produce wavelengths from 946 to 2010 nanometers. In addition, Q-switched operation with kilowatt peak powers and mode-locked operation with 10-picosecond pulse widths have been demonstrated. Progress in diode lasers and diode laser arrays promises all solid-state lasers in which the flash lamp is replaced by diode lasers for average power levels in excess of tens of watts and at a price that is competitive with flash lamp-pumped laser systems. Power levels exceeding 1 kilowatt appear possible within the next 5 years. Potential applications of diode laser-pumped solid-state lasers include coherent radar, global sensing from satellites, medical uses, micromachining, and miniature visible sources for digital optical storage.},

abstract = {A simple derivation in the Coulomb gauge of the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation describing propagation of powerful ultrashort circularly polarized laser pulses in underdense cold inhomogeneous plasmas is presented. Numerical solutions are given for the two-dimensional axisymmetric case for both initially homogeneous plasmas and static preformed plasma columns. These solutions account for (i) diffraction, (ii) refraction arising from variations in the refractive index due to the spatial profile of the electron density distribution, (iii) the relativistic electronic mass shift, and (iv) the charge displacement resulting from the transverse ponderomotive force. The most important spatial modes of propagation corresponding to (1) purely relativistic focusing and (2) the combined action of both the relativistic and charge-displacement mechanisms are described. The latter leads to the formation of stable confined modes of propagation having paraxially localized regions of high intensity and corresponding paraxially situated cavitated channels in the electron density. It is further demonstrated that the dynamical solutions of the propagation tend asymptotically to the lowest eigenmodes of the governing nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. Finally, the calculations illustrate the dynamics of the propagation and show that the relativistic mechanism promotes the initial concentration of the radiative energy and that the subsequent charge displacement stabilizes this confinement and produces waveguidelike channels. {\textcopyright} 1992 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Ultrahigh intensity lasers can potentially be used in conjunction with conventional fusion lasers to ignite inertial confinement fusion (ICF) capsules with a total energy of a few tens of kilojoules of laser light, and can possibly lead to high gain with as little as 100 kJ. A scheme is proposed with three phases. First, a capsule is imploded as in the conventional approach to inertial fusion to assemble a high-density fuel configuration. Second, a hole is bored through the capsule corona composed of ablated material, as the critical density is pushed close to the high-density core of the capsule by the ponderomotive force associated with high-intensity laser light. Finally, the fuel is ignited by suprathermal electrons, produced in the high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, which then propagate from critical density to this high-density core. This new scheme also drastically reduces the difficulty of the implosion, and thereby allows lower quality fabrication and less stringent beam quality and symmetry requirements from the implosion driver. The difficulty of the fusion scheme is transferred to the technological difficulty of producing the ultrahigh-intensity laser and of transporting this energy to the fuel. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Institute of Physics.},

The absorption and reflection of the ultraintense electromagnetic laser radiation from a sharp-boundary plasma, high harmonic generation, and the transformation into low-frequency radiation are discussed. In the case of weak plasma nonuniformity the excitation of nonlinear Langmuir oscillations in the plasma resonance region and the resulting electron acceleration are investigated. The vacuum heating of the electrons and the self-intersection of the electron trajectories are also studied. In the case of a sharp-boundary plasma, part of the energy of the laser pulse is found to be converted into a localized, relativistically strong, nonlinear electromagnetic pulse propagating into the plasma. The expansion of the hot electron cloud into the vacuum region and the action of the ponderomotive force of the laser pulse in the localized longitudinal electric field of the Langmuir oscillations lead to ion acceleration. The energy increase of a minority population of multicharged ions is found to be much greater than that of the ambient ions. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Institute of Physics.},

The SMI is found to dominate FRS in most regimes of interest. {\textcopyright} 2000 The American Physical Society.},

The depth dose distribution of electron beams compares favourably with photon beams. Effects caused by nuclear reactions are evaluated, including increased dose due to neutron production and induced radioactivity resulting in an increased relative biological effectiveness (RBE) factor of <1.03.},

abstract = {Sample damage by X-rays and other radiation limits the resolution of structural studies on non-repetitive and non-reproducible structures such as individual biomolecules or cells. Cooling can slow sample deterioration, but cannot eliminate damage-induced sample movement during the time needed for conventional measurements. Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per {\AA}2 with X-rays of 12keV energy or 1 {\AA} wavelength) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times. Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein molecules and small assemblies. Estimations of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that experiments using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample. We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural determinations with X- rays.},

Such lasers are capable of producing beams of energetic electrons, protons and $\gamma$-rays. Relativistic electrons are generated through the breaking of large-amplitude relativistic plasma waves created in the wake of the laser pulse as it propagates through a plasma, or through a direct interaction between the laser field and the electrons in the plasma. However, the electron beams produced from previous laser-plasma experiments have a large energy spread, limiting their use for potential applications. Here we report high-resolution energy measurements of the electron beams produced from intense laser-plasma interactions, showing that-under particular plasma conditions-it is possible to generate beams of relativistic electrons with low divergence and a small energy spread (less than three per cent). The monoenergetic features were observed in the electron energy spectrum for plasma densities just above a threshold required for breaking of the plasma wave. These features were observed consistently in the electron spectrum, although the energy of the beam was observed to vary from shot to shot. If the issue of energy reproducibility can be addressed, it should be possible to generate ultrashort monoenergetic electron bunches of tunable energy, holding great promise for the future development of 'table-top' particle accelerators.},

abstract = {Particle accelerators are used in a wide variety of fields, ranging from medicine and biology to high-energy physics. The accelerating fields in conventional accelerators are limited to a few tens of MeV m-1, owing to material breakdown at the walls of the structure. Thus, the production of energetic particle beams currently requires large-scale accelerators and expensive infrastructures. Laser-plasma accelerators have been proposed as a next generation of compact accelerators because of the huge electric fields they can sustain (>100 GeV m-1). However, it has been difficult to use them efficiently for applications because they have produced poor-quality particle beams with large energy spreads, owing to a randomization of electrons in phase space. Here we demonstrate that this randomization can be suppressed and that the quality of the electron beams can be dramatically enhanced. Within a length of 3 mm, the laser drives a plasma bubble that traps and accelerates plasma electrons. The resulting electron beam is extremely collimated and quasi-monoenergetic, with a high charge of 0.5 nC at 170 MeV.},

These fields are thousands of times greater than those achievable in conventional radio-frequency accelerators, spurring interest in laser accelerators as compact next-generation sources of energetic electrons and radiation. To date, however, acceleration distances have been severely limited by the lack of a controllable method for extending the propagation distance of the focused laser pulse. The ensuing short acceleration distance results in low-energy beams with 100 per cent electron energy spread, which limits potential applications. Here we demonstrate a laser accelerator that produces electron beams with an energy spread of a few per cent, low emittance and increased energy (more than 109 electrons above 80 MeV). Our technique involves the use of a preformed plasma density channel to guide a relativistically intense laser, resulting in a longer propagation distance.

In these accelerators, electrons surf on electric fields exceeding 100 GeV m -1 , which is more than 1,000 times stronger than achievable in conventional accelerators. These fields are generated within plasma structures (such as Langmuir waves or electron density 'bubbles') propagating near light speed behind laser or charged-particle driving pulses.

It is appropriate for describing plasma waves excited when all electrons are expelled out from a finite region by either the space charge of a short electron beam or the radiation pressure of a short intense laser. It works very well for the first bucket before phase mixing occurs. We separate the plasma response into a cavity or blowout region void of all electrons and a sheath of electrons just beyond the cavity. This simple model permits the derivation of a single equation for the boundary of the cavity. It works particularly well for narrow electron bunches and for short lasers with spot sizes matched to the radius of the cavity.

Using a model based on single-particle dynamics, various thermal effects are calculated, such as the evolution of the plasma temperature.

It is shown that the trapping threshold is increased within the region of the laser pulse. The laser intensity required to excite plasma waves of sufficient amplitude to trap background electrons is determined.

abstract = {The extraordinary ability of space-charge waves in plasmas to accelerate charged particles at gradients that are orders of magnitude greater than in current accelerators has been well documented. We develop a phenomenological framework for laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the 3D nonlinear regime, in which the plasma electrons are expelled by the radiation pressure of a short pulse laser, leading to nearly complete blowout. Our theory provides a recipe for designing a LWFA for given laser and plasma parameters and estimates the number and the energy of the accelerated electrons whether self-injected or externally injected. These formulas apply for self-guided as well as externally guided pulses (e.g. by plasma channels). We demonstrate our results by presenting a sample particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of a 30 fs, 200TW laser interacting with a 0.75cm long plasma with density 1.5×1018cm-3 to produce an ultrashort (10fs) monoenergetic bunch of self-injected electrons at 1.5GeV with 0.3nC of charge. For future higher-energy accelerator applications, we propose a parameter space, which is distinct from that described by Gordienko and Pukhov in that it involves lower plasma densities and wider spot sizes while keeping the intensity relatively constant. We find that this helps increase the output electron beam energy while keeping the efficiency high. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

This method is based on the radiation frequency multiplication during reflection at a mirror flying with relativistic velocity. The relativistic mirror is formed by the electron density modulations in a strongly nonlinear wake wave, excited in an underdense plasma in the wake behind an ultrashort laser pulse. In our experiments, the reflection of a countercrossing laser pulse from the wake wave is observed. The detected frequency multiplication factor is in the range from 55 to 114, corresponding to a reflected radiation wavelength from 7 to 15 nm. This may open a way towards tunable high-intensity sources of ultrashort coherent electromagnetic pulses in the extreme ultraviolet and x-ray spectral regions. Parameters of the reflecting wake wave can be determined using the reflected radiation as a probe. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

But at those capable of being produced by modern ultrahigh-intensity lasers, many new and potentially useful phenomena arise. When a pulse from such a laser hits an optically polished surface, it generates a dense plasma that itself acts as a mirror, known as a plasma mirror (PM). PMs do not just reflect the remainder of the incident beam, but can act as active optical elements. Using a set of three consecutive PMs in different regimes, we significantly improve the temporal contrast of femtosecond pulses, and demonstrate that high-order harmonics of the laser frequency can be generated through two distinct mechanisms. A better understanding of these processes should aid the development of laser-driven attosecond sources for use in fields from materials science to molecular biology. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Interaction of a high-power laser pulse having a sharp front with a thin plasma layer is considered. General one-dimensional numerical-analytical model is elaborated, in which the plasma layer is represented as a large collection of electron sheets, and a radiation reaction force is derived analytically. Using this model, trajectories of the electrons of the plasma layer are calculated numerically and compared with the electron trajectories obtained in particle-in-cell simulations, and a good agreement is found. Two simplified analytical models are considered, in which only one electron sheet is used, and it moves transversely and longitudinally in the fields of an ion sheet and a laser pulse (longitudinal displacements along the laser beam axis can be considerably larger than the laser wavelength). In the model I, a radiation reaction is included self-consistently, while in the model II a radiation reaction force is omitted. For the two models, analytical solutions for the dynamical parameters of the electron sheet in a linearly polarized laser pulse are derived and compared with the numerical solutions for the central electron sheet (positioned initially in the center) of the real plasma layer, which are calculated from the general numerical-analytical model. This comparison shows that the model II gives better description for the trajectory of the central electron sheet of the real plasma layer, while the model I gives more adequate description for a transverse momentum. Both models show that if the intensity of the laser pulse is high enough, even in the field with a constant amplitude, the electrons undergo not only the transverse oscillations with the period of the laser field, but also large (in comparison with the laser wavelength) longitudinal oscillations with the period, defined by the system parameters and initial conditions of particular oscillation. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Energy depletion of intense, short-pulse lasers via excitation of plasma waves is investigated numerically and analytically. The evolution of a resonant laser pulse proceeds in two phases. In the first phase, the pulse steepens, compresses, and frequency redshifts as energy is deposited in the plasma. The second phase of evolution occurs after the pulse reaches a minimum length at which point the pulse rapidly lengthens, losing resonance with the plasma. Expressions for the rate of laser energy loss and rate of laser redshifting are derived and are found to be in excellent agreement with the direct numerical solution of the laser field evolution coupled to the plasma response. Both processes are shown to have the same characteristic length scale. In the high intensity limit, for nearly resonant Gaussian laser pulses, this scale length is shown to be independent of laser intensity. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {An analytical theory for the interaction of an electron bunch with a nonlinear plasma wave is developed to make it possible to design efficient laser- and/or beam-driven accelerators that generate high quality monoenergetic electron beams. This theory shows how to choose the charge, the shape, and the placing of the bunch so that the conversion efficiency from the fields of the bubble to the accelerating electrons reaches nearly 100% and the beam quality is optimized. For intense drivers the nonlinear wake is described by the shape of the bubble and beam loading arises when the radial space-charge force of the beam acts back on the electron sheath surrounding the ion channel. The modification of the wake due to the presence of flat-top electron bunches is studied and it is shown that the energy spread of an externally injected flat-top electron bunch can be kept low. The bunch profile that leads to zero energy spread is also derived. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

The technologies underlying their production and measurement as well as relevant theoretical modeling have been reviewed in the pages of Reviews of Modern Physics (Brabec and Krausz, 2000). Since then, measurement and control of the subcycle field evolution of few-cycle light have opened the door to a radically new approach to exploring and controlling processes of the microcosm. The hyperfast-varying electric field of visible light permitted manipulation and tracking of the atomic-scale motion of electrons. Striking implications include controlled generation and measurement of single attosecond pulses of extreme ultraviolet light as well as trains of them, and real-time observation of atomic-scale electron dynamics. The tools and techniques for steering and tracing electronic motion in atoms, molecules, and nanostructures are now becoming available, marking the birth of attosecond physics.

abstract = {The damages triggered by ionizing radiation on chemical and biological targets depend on the survival probability of radicals produced in clusters of ionization-excitation events. In this paper, we report on femtolysis (FEMTOsecond radioLYSIS) of pure liquid water using an innovative laser produced high-energy, ultra-short electron bunches in the 2.5-15 MeV range and high energy radiation femtochemistry (HERF) measurements. The short-time monitoring of a primary reducing radical, hydrated electron eaq-, has been performed in confined ionization spaces (nascent spurs). The calculated yield of hydrated electrons at early time, G(eaq-)ET, is estimated to be 6.5 ± 0.5 (number/100 eV) at t ∼ 5 ps after the ultrafast energy deposition. This estimated value is high compare to (i) the available data of previous works that used scavenging techniques; (ii) the predictions of stochastic water radiolysis modelling for which the initial behaviour of hydrated electron is investigated in the framework of a classical diffusion regime of independent pairs. The HERF developments give new insights into the early ubiquitous radical escape probability in nascent aqueous spurs and emphasize the importance of short-lived solvent bridged electron-radical complexes [H3O+⋯ ∈ eaq- OH]nH2O (non-independent pairs). A complete understanding of the G(eaq-)ET value needs to account for quantum aspects of 1s-like trapped electron ground state and neoformed prototropic radicals that govern ultra-fast recombination processes within these non-independent pair configurations. Femtolysis data emphasize that within a time-dependent non-diffusion regime, spatio-temporal correlations between hydrated electron and nearest neighbours OH radical or hydrated proton (H3O+) would assist ultrafast anisotropic 1D recombination within solvent bridged electron-radical complexes. The emerging HERF domain would provide guidance for understanding of ultrashort-lived sub-structure of tracks and stimulate future semi-quantum simulations on prethermal radical reactions. {\textcopyright} 2010 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The field of focused pulses is described using a realistic three-dimensional model based on an exact solution of the Maxwell equations. The e+e- pair production threshold in terms of electromagnetic field energy can be substantially lowered if, instead of one or even two colliding pulses, multiple pulses are focused on one spot.

abstract = {One of the great dream experiments in Science is to directly observe atomic motions as they occur. Femtosecond electron diffraction provided the first 'light' of sufficient intensity to achieve this goal by attaining atomic resolution to structural changes on the relevant timescales. This review covers the technical progress that made this new level of acuity possible and gives a survey of the new insights gained from an atomic level perspective of structural dynamics. Atomic level views of the simplest possible structural transition, melting, are discussed for a number of systems in which both thermal and purely electronically driven atomic displacements can be correlated with the degree of directional bonding. Optical manipulation of charge distributions and effects on interatomic forces/bonding can be directly observed through the ensuing atomic motions. New phenomena involving strongly correlated electron-lattice systems are also discussed in which optically induced changes in the potential energy landscape lead to ballistic structural changes. Concepts such as the structural order parameters are now directly observable at the atomic level of inspection to give a remarkable view of the extraordinary degree of cooperativity involved in strongly correlated electron-lattice systems. These recent examples, in combination with time-resolved real space imaging now possible with electron probes, are truly defining an emerging field that holds great promise to make a significant impact in how we understand structural dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Modeling of laser-plasma wakefield accelerators in an optimal frame of reference [1] has been shown to produce orders of magnitude speed-up of calculations from first principles. Obtaining these speedups required mitigation of a high-frequency instability that otherwise limits effectiveness. In this paper, methods are presented which mitigated the observed instability, including an electromagnetic solver with tunable coefficients, its extension to accommodate Perfectly Matched Layers and Friedman's damping algorithms, as well as an efficient large bandwidth digital filter. It is observed that choosing the frame of the wake as the frame of reference allows for higher levels of filtering or damping than is possible in other frames for the same accuracy. Detailed testing also revealed the existence of a singular time step at which the instability level is minimized, independently of numerical dispersion. A combination of the techniques presented in this paper prove to be very efficient at controlling the instability, allowing for efficient direct modeling of 10.

abstract = {One of the major goals of research for laser-plasma accelerators is the realization of compact sources of femtosecond X-rays. In particular, using the modest electron energies obtained with existing laser systems, Compton scattering a photon beam off a relativistic electron bunch has been proposed as a source of high-energy and high-brightness photons. However, laser-plasma based approaches to Compton scattering have not, to date, produced X-rays above 1 keV. Here, we present a simple and compact scheme for a Compton source based on the combination of a laser-plasma accelerator and a plasma mirror. This approach is used to produce a broadband spectrum of X-rays extending up to hundreds of keV and with a 10,000-fold increase in brightness over Compton X-ray sources based on conventional accelerators. We anticipate that this technique will lead to compact, high-repetition-rate sources of ultrafast (femtosecond), tunable (X-through gamma-ray) and low-divergence (≈1/°) photons from source sizes on the order of a micrometre. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This is due to its extremely small cross section in this energy range. Since the cross section rapidly increases with photon energy, we propose measuring the photon-photon scattering cross section by upshifting optical lasers to the 100-eV to keV range using four relativistic mirror schemes and colliding them. In two of the schemes we find that although the number of scattering events is small with realistic laser parameters, measurement could be possible with an accumulation of a large number of laser shots. In the two other schemes a large number of scattering events is possible, however, the use of large future laser systems will be necessary. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

It is shown here that, when the charge of the bunch exceeds a few tens of picocoulombs, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations erroneously overestimate the emittance. This is mostly due the interaction of spurious Cherenkov radiation with the bunch, which leads to a steady growth of emittance during the simulation. A new computational scheme is proposed, which is free of spurious Cherenkov radiation. It can be easily implemented in existing PIC codes and leads to a substantial reduction of the emittance growth.},

Based on radiation from electrons accelerated in plasma, these sources have the common properties to be compact and to deliver collimated, incoherent, and femtosecond radiation. In this article, within a unified formalism, the betatron radiation of trapped and accelerated electrons in the so-called bubble regime, the synchrotron radiation of laser-accelerated electrons in usual meter-scale undulators, the nonlinear Thomson scattering from relativistic electrons oscillating in an intense laser field, and the Thomson backscattered radiation of a laser beam by laser-accelerated electrons are reviewed. The underlying physics is presented using ideal models, the relevant parameters are defined, and analytical expressions providing the features of the sources are given. Numerical simulations and a summary of recent experimental results on the different mechanisms are also presented. Each section ends with the foreseen development of each scheme. Finally, one of the most promising applications of laser-plasma accelerators is discussed: the realization of a compact free-electron laser in the x-ray range of the spectrum. In the conclusion, the relevant parameters characterizing each sources are summarized. Considering typical laser-plasma interaction parameters obtained with currently available lasers, examples of the source features are given. The sources are then compared to each other in order to define their field of applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

However, the energy and quality of the electron beam from the laser-wakefield accelerator have been limited by the power of the driving laser pulses and interaction properties in the target medium. Recent progress in laser technology has resulted in the realization of a petawatt (PW) femtosecond laser, which offers new capabilities for research on laser-wakefield acceleration. Here, we present a significant increase in laser-driven electron energy to the multi-GeV level by utilizing a 30-fs, 1-PW laser system. In particular, a dual-stage laser-wakefield acceleration scheme (injector and accelerator scheme) was applied to boost electron energies to over 3 GeV with a single PW laser pulse.

abstract = {We describe a modification to the finite-difference time-domain algorithm for electromagnetics on a Cartesian grid which eliminates numerical dispersion error in vacuum for waves propagating along a grid axis. We provide details of the algorithm, which generalizes previous work by allowing 3D operation with a wide choice of aspect ratio, and give conditions to eliminate dispersive errors along one or more of the coordinate axes. We discuss the algorithm in the context of laser-plasma acceleration simulation, showing significant reduction - up to a factor of 280, at a plasma density of 1023 m-3 - of the dispersion error of a linear laser pulse in a plasma channel. We then compare the new algorithm with the standard electromagnetic update for laser-plasma accelerator stage simulations, demonstrating that by controlling numerical dispersion, the new algorithm allows more accurate simulation than is otherwise obtained. We also show that the algorithm can be used to overcome the critical but difficult challenge of consistent initialization of a relativistic particle beam and its fields in an accelerator simulation.

In particular, Haber et al. presented in 1973 a pseudo-spectral solver that integrates analytically the solution over a finite time step, under the usual assumption that the source is constant over that time step. Yet, pseudo-spectral solvers have not been widely used, due in part to the difficulty for efficient parallelization owing to global communications associated with global FFTs on the entire computational domains.A method for the parallelization of electromagnetic pseudo-spectral solvers is proposed and tested on single electromagnetic pulses, and on Particle-In-Cell simulations of the wakefield formation in a laser plasma accelerator.The method takes advantage of the properties of the Discrete Fourier Transform, the linearity of Maxwell's equations and the finite speed of light for limiting the communications of data within guard regions between neighboring computational domains.Although this requires a small approximation, test results show that no significant error is made on the test cases that have been presented.The proposed method opens the way to solvers combining the favorable parallel scaling of standard finite-difference methods with the accuracy advantages of pseudo-spectral methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A laser-boosted relativistic solid-density paraboloidal foil is known to efficiently reflect and focus a counterpropagating laser pulse. Here we show that in the case of an ultrarelativistic counterpropagating pulse, a high-energy and ultrahigh-intensity reflected pulse can be more effectively generated by a relatively slow and heavy foil than by a fast and light one. This counterintuitive result is explained with the larger reflectivity of a heavy foil, which compensates for its lower relativistic Doppler factor. Moreover, since the counterpropagating pulse is ultrarelativistic, the foil is abruptly dispersed and only the first few cycles of the counterpropagating pulse are reflected. Our multidimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that even few-cycle counterpropagating laser pulses can be further shortened (both temporally and in the number of laser cycles) with pulse amplification. A single few-cycle, multipetawatt laser pulse with several joules of energy and with a peak intensity exceeding 1023W/cm2 can be generated already employing next-generation high-power laser systems. In addition, the carrier-envelope phase of the generated few-cycle pulse can be tuned provided that the carrier-envelope phase of the initial counterpropagating pulse is controlled. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Optical Society of America. The focusing property of a focal spot of a femtosecond laser pulse is presented under tight focusing conditions (below f-number of 1). The spatial and temporal intensity distributions of a focused electric field are calculated by vector diffraction integrals and coherent superposition method. The validity of the calculation method is examined by comparing the intensity distribution obtained under a high f-number condition to that obtained with the fast Fourier transform method that assumes the scalar paraxial approximation. The spatial and temporal modifications under tight focusing conditions are described for a focused femtosecond laser pulse. The calculation results show that a peak intensity of about 2.5×10 24 W/cm 2 can be achievable by tightly focusing a 12-fs, 10 PW laser pulse with a f/0.5 parabolic optic. The precise information on intensity distributions of a femtosecond focal spot obtained under a tight focusing condition will be crucial in assessing a focused intensity and in describing the motion of charged particles under an extremely strong electric field in ultra-relativistic and/or relativistic laser matter-interaction studies.},

These electron rings had 170-280 MeV energies with 5%-25% energy spread and ∼10pC of charge and were observed over a range of plasma densities and compositions. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that laser intensity enhancement in the wake leads to sheath splitting and the formation of a hollow toroidal pocket in the electron density around the wake behind the first wake period. If the laser propagates over a distance greater than the ideal dephasing length, some of the dephasing electrons in the second period can become trapped within the pocket and form an ultrarelativistic electron ring that propagates in free space over a meter-scale distance upon exiting the plasma. Such a structure acts as a relativistic potential well, which has applications for accelerating positively charged particles such as positrons.},

abstract = {Enhancement of the quality of laser wake-field accelerated (LWFA) electron beams implies the improvement and controllability of the properties of the wake waves generated by ultra-short pulse lasers in underdense plasmas. In this work we present a compendium of useful formulas giving relations between the laser and plasma target parameters allowing one to obtain basic dependences, e.g. the energy scaling of the electrons accelerated by the wake field excited in inhomogeneous media including multi-stage LWFA accelerators. Consideration of the effects of using the chirped laser pulse driver allows us to find the regimes where the chirp enhances the wake field amplitude. We present an analysis of the three-dimensional effects on the electron beam loading and on the unlimited LWFA acceleration in inhomogeneous plasmas. Using the conditions of electron trapping to the wake-field acceleration phase we analyse the multi-equal stage and multiuneven stage LWFA configurations. In the first configuration the energy of fast electrons is a linear function of the number of stages, and in the second case, the accelerated electron energy grows exponentially with the number of stages. The results of the two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations presented here show the high quality electron acceleration in the triple stage injection-acceleration configuration.},

Generation of these beams is associated with injection occurring on the density down ramp between the stages. This well-localized injection produces a bunch of electrons performing coherent betatron oscillations in the wakefield, resulting in a significant increase in the x-ray yield. Annular electron distributions are detected in 40% of shots under optimal conditions. Simultaneous control of the pulse duration and frequency chirp enables optimization of both the energy and the energy spread of the annular beam and boosts the radiant energy per unit charge by almost an order of magnitude.

abstract = {Very high order or pseudo-spectral Maxwell solvers are the method of choice to reduce discretization effects (e.g. numerical dispersion) that are inherent to low order Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) schemes. However, due to their large stencils, these solvers are often subject to truncation errors in many electromagnetic simulations. These truncation errors come from non-physical modifications of Maxwell's equations in space that may generate spurious signals affecting the overall accuracy of the simulation results. Such modifications for instance occur when Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) are used at simulation domain boundaries to simulate open media. Another example is the use of arbitrary order Maxwell solver with domain decomposition technique that may under some condition involve stencil truncations at subdomain boundaries, resulting in small spurious errors that do eventually build up. In each case, a careful evaluation of the characteristics and magnitude of the errors resulting from these approximations, and their impact at any frequency and angle, requires detailed analytical and numerical studies. To this end, we present a general analytical approach that enables the evaluation of numerical errors of fully three-dimensional arbitrary order finite-difference Maxwell solver, with arbitrary modification of the local stencil in the simulation domain. The analytical model is validated against simulations of domain decomposition technique and PMLs, when these are used with very high-order Maxwell solver, as well as in the infinite order limit of pseudo-spectral solvers. Results confirm that the new analytical approach enables exact predictions in each case. It also confirms that the domain decomposition technique can be used with very high-order Maxwell solvers and a reasonably low number of guard cells with negligible effects on the whole accuracy of the simulation.},

However, accelerators generating such currents operate in the beam loading regime where the accelerating field is strongly modified by the self-fields of the injected bunch, potentially deteriorating key beam parameters. Here we demonstrate that, if appropriately controlled, the beam loading effect can be employed to improve the accelerator's performance. Self-Truncated ionization injection enables loading of unprecedented charges of {\^{a}}=0.5 nC within a mono-energetic peak. As the energy balance is reached, we show that the accelerator operates at the theoretically predicted optimal loading condition and the final energy spread is minimized.},

abstract = {Time-centered, hence second-order, methods for integrating the relativistic momentum of charged particles in an electromagnetic field are derived. A new method is found by averaging the momentum before use in the magnetic rotation term, and an implementation is presented that differs from the relativistic Boris Push only in the method for calculating the Lorentz factor. This is shown to have the same second-order accuracy in time as that found by splitting the electric acceleration and magnetic rotation (Boris Push) and that found by averaging the velocity in the magnetic rotation term (Vay's method) [J.-L. Vay, Phys. Plasmas 15, 056701 (2008)]. All three methods are shown to conserve energy when there is no electric field. The Boris Push and the current method are shown to be volume-preserving, while Vay's method and the current method preserve the E→×B→ velocity. Thus, of these second-order relativistic momentum integrations, only the integrator introduced here both preserves volume and gives the correct E→×B→ velocity. While all methods have error that is second-order in time, they deviate from each other by terms that increase as the motion becomes relativistic. Numerical results show that Vay's method develops energy errors near resonant orbits of a test problem that neither volume-preserving integrator does.},

abstract = {Laser-wakefield accelerators are compact devices capable of delivering ultra-short electron bunches with pC-level charge and MeV-GeV energy by exploiting the ultra-high electric fields arising from the interaction of intense laser pulses with plasma. We show experimentally and through numerical simulations that a high-energy electron beam is produced simultaneously with two stable lower-energy beams that are ejected in oblique and counter-propagating directions, typically carrying off 5-10% of the initial laser energy. A MeV, 10s nC oblique beam is ejected in a 30°-60° hollow cone, which is filled with more energetic electrons determined by the injection dynamics. A nC-level, 100s keV backward-directed beam is mainly produced at the leading edge of the plasma column. We discuss the apportioning of absorbed laser energy amongst the three beams. Knowledge of the distribution of laser energy and electron beam charge, which determine the overall efficiency, is important for various applications of laser-wakefield accelerators, including the development of staged high-energy accelerators.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 SPIE. Large laser systems that deliver optical pulses with peak powers exceeding one Petawatt (PW) have been constructed at dozens of research facilities worldwide and have fostered research in High-Energy-Density (HED) Science, High-Field and nonlinear physics [1]. Furthermore, the high intensities exceeding 10 18 W/cm 2 allow for efficiently driving secondary sources that inherit some of the properties of the laser pulse, e.g. pulse duration, spatial and/or divergence characteristics. In the intervening decades since that first PW laser, single-shot proof-of-principle experiments have been successful in demonstrating new high-intensity laser-matter interactions and subsequent secondary particle and photon sources. These secondary sources include generation and acceleration of charged-particle (electron, proton, ion) and neutron beams, and X-ray and gamma-ray sources, generation of radioisotopes for positron emission tomography (PET), targeted cancer therapy, medical imaging, and the transmutation of radioactive waste [2, 3]. Each of these promising applications requires lasers with peak power of hundreds of terawatt (TW) to petawatt (PW) and with average power of tens to hundreds of kW to achieve the required secondary source flux.},

abstract = {The question of whether Hawking evaporation violates unitarity, and therefore results in the loss of information, has remained unresolved since Hawking's seminal discovery. To date, the investigations have remained mostly theoretical since it is almost impossible to settle this paradox through direct astrophysical black hole observations. Here, we point out that relativistic plasma mirrors can be accelerated drastically and stopped abruptly by impinging intense x-ray pulses on solid plasma targets with a density gradient. This is analogous to the late time evolution of black hole Hawking evaporation. A conception of such an experiment is proposed and a self-consistent set of physical parameters is presented. Critical issues, such as how the black hole unitarity may be preserved, can be addressed through the entanglement between the analog Hawking radiation photons and their partner modes.},

Here, we present the results of several experimental campaigns performed with different irradiances, analyse the obtained results and derive the required laser parameters. In particular, we found that the root mean square (RMS) wavefront error should be smaller than similar to 100 nm (similar to lambda/8). Further, the angular dispersion should be kept considerably smaller than the diffraction divergence, i.e., mu rad level for 100-300-mm beam diameters. The corresponding angular chirp should not exceed 10(-2) mu rad/nm for a 40-nm bandwidth.

abstract = {Ultra-relativistic hollow electron beams can drive plasma wakefields (∼GV/m) suitable for positron acceleration. Stable propagation of hollow electron beams for long distances in plasmas is required to accelerate positrons to high energies by these plasma wakefields. In this work, we show by quasi-static kinetic simulations using the code WAKE that an ultra-relativistic azimuthally symmetric hollow electron beam with zero emittance propagates in a plasma by developing a fish-bone like structure and shifting its bulk, differentially along its length (rear part fastest), towards its axis due to the decrease in the betatron time period of beam electrons from the beam-front to beam-rear. Hollow electron beams with a small radius collapse into their axis due to the pull by the secondary wakefields generated by some of the beam electrons reaching the axis. Hollow beams with the radius equal to or larger than a minimum value, however, can propagate stably in plasmas for several meters. The minimum beam radius for the stable beam propagation in plasmas depends very weakly on the peak beam density with which the magnitude of the positron-accelerating electric field increases. Thus, the peak beam density can be used as a control parameter to achieve high acceleration gradients for positrons without affecting the minimum beam radius.},

The gas jet uses a range of capillary nozzles with inner diameters between 50 and 150 $\mu$m and is operated in the sonic regime. Cryogenic cooling of the gas valve body to -160 °C provides the necessary density enhancement for reaching overcritical plasma densities at $\lambda$ = 800 nm (Ncr ≈ 1.7 × 1021 cm-3) using hydrogen gas at jet backing pressures below 1000 psi. Under certain conditions, fast expansion of the gas from a nozzle can lead to formation of clusters; here, we use our previously demonstrated all-optical method to estimate the cluster mean size and density. For the jets studied here, we find that cluster formation only begins at distances from the nozzle exit greater than a few times the nozzle orifice diameter.},

The pulse duration lasts typically a few optical cycle, feeding six attosecond beamlines, two particle and two THz beamlines, as well as many end stations associated with the beamlines [1]. The first 100 kHz repetition rate lasers have been installed by end 2017, and became available for experiments from the beginning of 2018. The Mid-InfraRed laser (MIR) provides 150 µJ, 40 fs pulses at 3.1µm [2]. The first High-Repetition rate laser (HR1) has been operating in long pulse mode (1.5 mJ, 40 fs pulses at 1030 nm). The short pulse operation mode (1mJ, <7fs) will be completed by March 2019. The second High-repetition Rate laser (HR2) offering 5 mJ and sub-7 fs pulses, will be commissioned by mid 2019. The kHz repetition rate SYLOS laser [3] has been completed its second development phase for providing >5 TW peak power pulses at sub-7 fs pulse duration. The system is available to run four beamlines from April 2019. In the meanwhile, parallel to its operation, the final upgrade stage will be developed, reaching an energy of >100 mJ by mid 2020. In order to serve the four beamlines efficiently, a so called SYLOS experimental alignment laser has been implemented. The laser “mimicking” the SYLOS laser at lower repetition rate, providing the similar beam size, peak intensity, and duration (3.8TW, 12 fs) at 10Hz repetition rate is available from end 2018. The High Field Petawatt (HF PW) laser of ALPS has been designed to operate at 10 Hz repetition rate with a pulse duration shorter than 17 fs. The system is under installation, 10 Hz operation at 0.4PW level will be reached by mid 2019, while the full 10Hz operation will be demonstrated by Fall 2020. We also carry on experiments towards the elimination of bottlenecks of high repetition rate sub-10fs operation of the 100Hz branch of the HF laser. The MIR and HR1 lasers have successfully served almost ten commissioning user experiments with external collaborators, investigating phenomena like electron migration in water, K-shell excited elections, etc., altogether for 51 operational weeks in 2018. Next year we expect to extend the commissioning experiments for the SYLOS laser as well as at least two attosecond and THz beamlines. The challenge of the laser R&D to design and implement such lasers was taken by the industry (EKSPLA, Light Conversion (both Lithuania), Fastlite, Amplitude Technologies (both France), AFS GmbH (Germany)), academia, and ELI-ALPS, resulting in a change of paradigm in laser engineering, leading to novel state of the art research grade lasers just in a few years.

abstract = {Laser-plasma interaction experiments using a 70 TW short-pulse laser were conducted to investigate the properties of electron beams produced from laser wakefield acceleration. In addition to narrow divergence electron beams in excess of 200 MeV, lower energy components of the electron beam were observed to have an annular emission pattern with much larger divergence. This ring-shaped component of the beam is up to several MeV in energy and gives rise to a corresponding increase in the divergence of bremsstrahlung X-rays while producing more background radiation. Scaling measurements of the emission angle of the beam with respect to plasma density were also made. From 3D numerical simulations of the interaction, it is shown that this phenomenon results from energetic electrons in the laser-driven wakefield which are not trapped by the plasma wave, but which can still obtain some longitudinal momentum from the interaction.},

abstract = {The extreme light infrastructure attosecond light pulse source offers beamtime for users of various attosecond and particle sources driven by versatile laser systems. Here we report on the state of the art of a few-cycle, multi-TW, 1kHz repetition rate laser system, now fully operational in the facility. The system is based on four stages of optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) pumped by a total of 320mJ, 80ps frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser pulses. All OPA stages utilize double crystal configuration, which design has been also confirmed by model calculations. The 1kHz SYLOS 2 system produces 32mJ laser pulses around a central wavelength of 891nm with 6.6fs (<2.3 optical cycles) pulse duration exceeding the peak power of 4.8 TW on a daily basis. The recorded best pulse duration is 6.3fs, which corresponds to 2.12 cycles and 5.1 TW peak power. During long-term (24h) performance tests, energy stability of 1.2%, carrier-envelope phase (CEP) stability of 210mrad, and pointing stability of 0.4$\mu$rad were demonstrated, while the Strehl ratio of the beam is kept above 0.75. In order to help the alignment of all the different experiments at the facility and to reduce the workload on SYLOS 2 system, a second laser system has been developed. The so-called SYLOS Experimental Alignment (SEA) laser mimicks the performance of the SYLOS 2 laser, but at a repetition rate two orders of magnitude lower and without CEP-stabilization. The three single-crystal OPA stages of the SEA laser provide 42mJ pulse energy for the users, while having energy stability of 0.87% and sub-13fs pulse duration at a repetition rate ranging from a single shot up to 10Hz.},

It has been a long-standing challenge to unite two hitherto distinct classes of light sources: those achieving relativistic intensity and those with pulse durations approaching a single light cycle. While the former class traditionally involves large-scale amplification chains, the latter class places high demand on the spatiotemporal control of the electromagnetic laser field. Here, we present a light source producing waveform-controlled 1.5-cycle pulses with a 719 nm central wavelength that can be focused to relativistic intensity at a 1 kHz repetition rate based on nonlinear post-compression in a long hollow-core fiber. The unique capabilities of this source allow us to observe the first experimental indications of light waveform effects in laser wakefield acceleration of relativistic energy electrons.},

The ELI project consists of three pillars being built in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania. This challenging proposal is based on recent technical progress allowing ultraintense laser fields in which intensities will soon be reaching as high as I0 ∼1023 W cm-2. This tremendous technological advance has been brought about by the invention of chirped pulse amplification by Mourou and Strickland. Romania is hosting the ELI for Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) pillar in Magurele near Bucharest. The new facility, currently under construction, is intended to serve the broad national, European, and international scientific community. Its mission covers scientific research at the frontier of knowledge involving two domains. The first is laser-driven experiments related to NP, strong-field quantum electrodynamics, and associated vacuum effects. The second research domain is based on the establishment of a Compton-backscattering-based, high-brilliance, and intense $\gamma$ beam with E$\gamma$ ≲ 19.5 MeV, which represents a merger between laser and accelerator technology. This system will allow the investigation of the nuclear structure of selected isotopes and nuclear reactions of relevance, for example, to astrophysics with hitherto unprecedented resolution and accuracy. In addition to fundamental themes, a large number of applications with significant societal impact will be developed. The implementation of the project started in January 2013 and is spearheaded by the ELI-NP/Horia Hulubei National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN-HH). Experiments will begin in early 2020.},

After wavefront correction and tight focusing with a two-stage adaptive optical system and an f/1.1 (f = 300 mm) off-axis parabolic mirror, we obtained near diffraction-limited focusing with a spot size of 1.1 µm (FWHM). From the measurement of 80 consecutive laser shots at 0.1 Hz, we achieved a peak intensity of (1.1 ± 0.2) × 10 23 W/cm 2 , verifying the applicability of the ultrahigh intensity PW laser for ultrahigh intensity laser-matter interactions. From the statistical analysis of the PW laser shots, we identified that the intensity fluctuation originated from air turbulence in the laser beam path and beam pointing. Our achievement could accelerate the study of strong field quantum electrodynamics by enabling exploration of nonlinear Compton scattering and Breit-Wheeler pair production.},

abstract = {The question of electromagnetic field intensification towards the values typical for strong field Quantum Electrodynamics is of fundamental importance. One of the most promising intensification schemes is based on the relativistic-flying mirror concept, which shows that the electromagnetic radiation reflected by the mirror will be frequency up-shifted by a factor of 4 gamma^2 (gamma: the Lorentz factor of the mirror). In laser-plasma interactions, such a mirror travels with relativistic velocities and typically has a parabolic form, which is advantageous for light intensification. Thus, a relativistic-flying parabolic mirror reflects the counter-propagating radiation in a form of focused and flying electromagnetic wave with a high frequency. The relativistic-flying motion of the laser focus makes the electric and magnetic field distributions of the focus complicated, and the mathematical expressions describing the field distributions of the focus is important. We present analytical expressions describing the field distribution formed by an ideal flying mirror having a perfect reflectance over the entire surface and wavelength range. The peak field strength of an incident laser pulse with a center wavelength of lambda_0 and an effective beam radius of w_e is enhanced by a factor proportional to gamma^3 (w_e/lambda_0) in the relativistic limit. Electron-positron pair production is investigated in the context of invariant fields based on the enhanced electromagnetic field. The pair production rate under the relativistic-flying laser focus is modified by the Lorentz gamma-factor and the beam radius-wavelength ratio (w_e/lambda_0). We show that the electron-positron pairs can be created by colliding two counter-propagating relativistic-flying laser focuses in vacuum, each of which is formed when a 180 TW laser pulse is reflected by a relativistic-flying parabolic mirror with a gamma = 12.2.},

@article{Li2021,
abstract = {The rapid development of the optical-cycle-level ultra-fast laser technologies may break through the bottleneck of the traditional ultra-intense laser [i.e., Petawatt (PW, 1015 W) laser currently] and enable the generation of even higher peak-power/intensity lasers. Herein, we simulate an ultra-broadband concept for the realization of an Exawatt-class (EW, 1018 W) high peak-power laser, where the wide-angle non-collinear optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification (WNOPCPA) is combined with the thin-plate post-compression. A frequency-chirped carrier-envelope-phase stable super-continuum laser is amplified to high-energy in WNOPCPA by pumping with two pump-beamlets and injected into the thin-plate post-compression to generate a sub-optical-cycle high-energy laser pulse. The numerical simulation shows this hybrid concept significantly enhances the gain bandwidth in the high-energy amplifier and the spectral broadening in the post-compression. By using this concept, a study of a prototype design of a 0.5 EW system is presented, and several key challenges are also examined.},

abstract = {Abstract: Collective methods of charged particle acceleration provide an approach towards achieving high-energy particle beams with relatively compact accelerator facilities. Among the collective acceleration methods, one of the central places belong to the electron Laser Wakefield Acceleration concept, when the regular accelerating structure in the form of longitudinal electrostatic wave propagating with the phase speed close to speed of light in vacuum is generated by ultrashort laser pulse in collisionless plasma. The review article contains theoretical description of charged particle (electron) interaction with various configurations of the electromagnetic field and with the longitudinal plasma waves. The radiation dominated regimes of the electron interaction with strong electromagnetic waves, when the radiation friction force effects play the key role, are also discussed.},
