abstract = {High-intensity lasers are critical for the exploration of strong field quantum electrodynamics. We report here a demonstration of laser intensity exceeding 10 23 W/cm 2 with the CoReLS petawatt (PW) laser. After wavefront correction and tight focusing with a two-stage adaptive optical system and an f/1.1 (f = 300 mm) off-axis parabolic mirror, we obtained near diffraction-limited focusing with a spot size of 1.1 µm (FWHM). From the measurement of 80 consecutive laser shots at 0.1 Hz, we achieved a peak intensity of (1.1 ± 0.2) × 10 23 W/cm 2 , verifying the applicability of the ultrahigh intensity PW laser for ultrahigh intensity laser-matter interactions. From the statistical analysis of the PW laser shots, we identified that the intensity fluctuation originated from air turbulence in the laser beam path and beam pointing. Our achievement could accelerate the study of strong field quantum electrodynamics by enabling exploration of nonlinear Compton scattering and Breit-Wheeler pair production.},

These solutions can provide for a very efficient focusing of electromagnetic field and can be generated by 4$\pi$ focusing systems, such as parabolic mirrors, by using radially polarized laser pulses with a suitable amplitude profile. The particular cases of a monochromatic dipole wave and a short dipole pulse with either quasi-Gaussian or Gaussian envelopes in the far-field region are analyzed and compared in detail. As a result, we propose how to increase the maximum field amplitude in the focus by properly shaping the temporal profile of the input laser pulses with given main wavelength and peak power. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Optical Society of America. The focusing property of a focal spot of a femtosecond laser pulse is presented under tight focusing conditions (below f-number of 1). The spatial and temporal intensity distributions of a focused electric field are calculated by vector diffraction integrals and coherent superposition method. The validity of the calculation method is examined by comparing the intensity distribution obtained under a high f-number condition to that obtained with the fast Fourier transform method that assumes the scalar paraxial approximation. The spatial and temporal modifications under tight focusing conditions are described for a focused femtosecond laser pulse. The calculation results show that a peak intensity of about 2.5×10 24 W/cm 2 can be achievable by tightly focusing a 12-fs, 10 PW laser pulse with a f/0.5 parabolic optic. The precise information on intensity distributions of a femtosecond focal spot obtained under a tight focusing condition will be crucial in assessing a focused intensity and in describing the motion of charged particles under an extremely strong electric field in ultra-relativistic and/or relativistic laser matter-interaction studies.},

It is shown that the multiple pulse configuration is beneficial for observing e+e- pair production from a vacuum under the action of sufficiently strong electromagnetic fields. The field of focused pulses is described using a realistic three-dimensional model based on an exact solution of the Maxwell equations. The e+e- pair production threshold in terms of electromagnetic field energy can be substantially lowered if, instead of one or even two colliding pulses, multiple pulses are focused on one spot. The multiple pulse interaction geometry gives rise to subwavelength field features in the focal region. These features result in the production of extremely short e+e- bunches. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

With the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics being awarded to Professors Donna Strickland and Gerard Mourou for the development of the technique of chirped pulse amplification (CPA), which made these lasers possible, we celebrate by providing a comprehensive update of the current status of ultra-high-power lasers and demonstrate how the technology has developed. We are now in the era of multi-petawatt facilities coming online, with 100 PW lasers being proposed and even under construction. In addition to this there is a pull towards development of industrial and multi-disciplinary applications, which demands much higher repetition rates, delivering high-average powers with higher efficiencies and the use of alternative wavelengths: mid-IR facilities. So apart from a comprehensive update of the current global status, we want to look at what technologies are to be deployed to get to these new regimes, and some of the critical issues facing their development.},

Herein, we simulate an ultra-broadband concept for the realization of an Exawatt-class (EW, 1018 W) high peak-power laser, where the wide-angle non-collinear optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification (WNOPCPA) is combined with the thin-plate post-compression. A frequency-chirped carrier-envelope-phase stable super-continuum laser is amplified to high-energy in WNOPCPA by pumping with two pump-beamlets and injected into the thin-plate post-compression to generate a sub-optical-cycle high-energy laser pulse. The numerical simulation shows this hybrid concept significantly enhances the gain bandwidth in the high-energy amplifier and the spectral broadening in the post-compression. By using this concept, a study of a prototype design of a 0.5 EW system is presented, and several key challenges are also examined.},

The ELI project consists of three pillars being built in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania. This challenging proposal is based on recent technical progress allowing ultraintense laser fields in which intensities will soon be reaching as high as I0 ∼1023 W cm-2. This tremendous technological advance has been brought about by the invention of chirped pulse amplification by Mourou and Strickland. Romania is hosting the ELI for Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) pillar in Magurele near Bucharest. The new facility, currently under construction, is intended to serve the broad national, European, and international scientific community. Its mission covers scientific research at the frontier of knowledge involving two domains. The first is laser-driven experiments related to NP, strong-field quantum electrodynamics, and associated vacuum effects. The second research domain is based on the establishment of a Compton-backscattering-based, high-brilliance, and intense $\gamma$ beam with E$\gamma$ ≲ 19.5 MeV, which represents a merger between laser and accelerator technology. This system will allow the investigation of the nuclear structure of selected isotopes and nuclear reactions of relevance, for example, to astrophysics with hitherto unprecedented resolution and accuracy. In addition to fundamental themes, a large number of applications with significant societal impact will be developed. The implementation of the project started in January 2013 and is spearheaded by the ELI-NP/Horia Hulubei National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN-HH). Experiments will begin in early 2020.},

Here, we present the results of several experimental campaigns performed with different irradiances, analyse the obtained results and derive the required laser parameters. In particular, we found that the root mean square (RMS) wavefront error should be smaller than similar to 100 nm (similar to lambda/8). Further, the angular dispersion should be kept considerably smaller than the diffraction divergence, i.e., mu rad level for 100-300-mm beam diameters. The corresponding angular chirp should not exceed 10(-2) mu rad/nm for a 40-nm bandwidth. We show the status of the J-KAREN-P laser (Kiriyama et al., 2015; Pirozhkov et al., 2017) and report on the progress towards satisfying these requirements.},

Thus, for sufficiently small subtended solid angle, an object will appear-optically-the same shape to all observers. A sphere will photograph with precisely the same circular outline whether stationary or in motion with respect to the camera. An object of less symmetry than a sphere, such as a meter stick, will appear, when in rapid motion with respect to an observer, to have undergone rotation, not contraction. The extent of this rotation is given by the aberration angle ($\theta$-$\theta$′), in which $\theta$ is the angle at which the object is seen by the observer and $\theta$′ is the angle at which the object would be seen by another observer at the same point stationary with respect to the object. Observers photographing the meter stick simultaneously from the same position will obtain precisely the same picture, except for a change in scale given by the Doppler shift ratio, irrespective of their velocity relative to the meter stick. Even if methods of measuring distance, such as stereoscopic photography, are used, the Lorentz contraction will not be visible, although correction for the finite velocity of light will reveal it to be present. {\textcopyright} 1959 The American Physical Society.},

These results demonstrate the generation of high-quality electron beams from a few-cycle-pulse-driven laser plasma accelerator without the need for carrier-envelope phase stabilization.},

abstract = {Ultrahigh intensity lasers can potentially be used in conjunction with conventional fusion lasers to ignite inertial confinement fusion (ICF) capsules with a total energy of a few tens of kilojoules of laser light, and can possibly lead to high gain with as little as 100 kJ. A scheme is proposed with three phases. First, a capsule is imploded as in the conventional approach to inertial fusion to assemble a high-density fuel configuration. Second, a hole is bored through the capsule corona composed of ablated material, as the critical density is pushed close to the high-density core of the capsule by the ponderomotive force associated with high-intensity laser light. Finally, the fuel is ignited by suprathermal electrons, produced in the high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, which then propagate from critical density to this high-density core. This new scheme also drastically reduces the difficulty of the implosion, and thereby allows lower quality fabrication and less stringent beam quality and symmetry requirements from the implosion driver. The difficulty of the fusion scheme is transferred to the technological difficulty of producing the ultrahigh-intensity laser and of transporting this energy to the fuel. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Institute of Physics.},

In addition to narrow divergence electron beams in excess of 200 MeV, lower energy components of the electron beam were observed to have an annular emission pattern with much larger divergence. This ring-shaped component of the beam is up to several MeV in energy and gives rise to a corresponding increase in the divergence of bremsstrahlung X-rays while producing more background radiation. Scaling measurements of the emission angle of the beam with respect to plasma density were also made. From 3D numerical simulations of the interaction, it is shown that this phenomenon results from energetic electrons in the laser-driven wakefield which are not trapped by the plasma wave, but which can still obtain some longitudinal momentum from the interaction.},

abstract = {Ultrarelativistic-energy electron ring structures have been observed from laser-wakefield acceleration experiments in the blowout regime. These electron rings had 170-280 MeV energies with 5%-25% energy spread and ∼10pC of charge and were observed over a range of plasma densities and compositions. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that laser intensity enhancement in the wake leads to sheath splitting and the formation of a hollow toroidal pocket in the electron density around the wake behind the first wake period. If the laser propagates over a distance greater than the ideal dephasing length, some of the dephasing electrons in the second period can become trapped within the pocket and form an ultrarelativistic electron ring that propagates in free space over a meter-scale distance upon exiting the plasma. Such a structure acts as a relativistic potential well, which has applications for accelerating positively charged particles such as positrons.},

Generation of these beams is associated with injection occurring on the density down ramp between the stages. This well-localized injection produces a bunch of electrons performing coherent betatron oscillations in the wakefield, resulting in a significant increase in the x-ray yield. Annular electron distributions are detected in 40% of shots under optimal conditions. Simultaneous control of the pulse duration and frequency chirp enables optimization of both the energy and the energy spread of the annular beam and boosts the radiant energy per unit charge by almost an order of magnitude. These well-defined annular distributions of electrons are a promising source of high-brightness laser plasma-based x rays.},

We show experimentally and through numerical simulations that a high-energy electron beam is produced simultaneously with two stable lower-energy beams that are ejected in oblique and counter-propagating directions, typically carrying off 5-10% of the initial laser energy. A MeV, 10s nC oblique beam is ejected in a 30°-60° hollow cone, which is filled with more energetic electrons determined by the injection dynamics. A nC-level, 100s keV backward-directed beam is mainly produced at the leading edge of the plasma column. We discuss the apportioning of absorbed laser energy amongst the three beams. Knowledge of the distribution of laser energy and electron beam charge, which determine the overall efficiency, is important for various applications of laser-wakefield accelerators, including the development of staged high-energy accelerators.},

In particular, using the modest electron energies obtained with existing laser systems, Compton scattering a photon beam off a relativistic electron bunch has been proposed as a source of high-energy and high-brightness photons. However, laser-plasma based approaches to Compton scattering have not, to date, produced X-rays above 1 keV. Here, we present a simple and compact scheme for a Compton source based on the combination of a laser-plasma accelerator and a plasma mirror. This approach is used to produce a broadband spectrum of X-rays extending up to hundreds of keV and with a 10,000-fold increase in brightness over Compton X-ray sources based on conventional accelerators. We anticipate that this technique will lead to compact, high-repetition-rate sources of ultrafast (femtosecond), tunable (X-through gamma-ray) and low-divergence (≈1/°) photons from source sizes on the order of a micrometre. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {One of the great dream experiments in Science is to directly observe atomic motions as they occur. Femtosecond electron diffraction provided the first 'light' of sufficient intensity to achieve this goal by attaining atomic resolution to structural changes on the relevant timescales. This review covers the technical progress that made this new level of acuity possible and gives a survey of the new insights gained from an atomic level perspective of structural dynamics. Atomic level views of the simplest possible structural transition, melting, are discussed for a number of systems in which both thermal and purely electronically driven atomic displacements can be correlated with the degree of directional bonding. Optical manipulation of charge distributions and effects on interatomic forces/bonding can be directly observed through the ensuing atomic motions. New phenomena involving strongly correlated electron-lattice systems are also discussed in which optically induced changes in the potential energy landscape lead to ballistic structural changes. Concepts such as the structural order parameters are now directly observable at the atomic level of inspection to give a remarkable view of the extraordinary degree of cooperativity involved in strongly correlated electron-lattice systems. These recent examples, in combination with time-resolved real space imaging now possible with electron probes, are truly defining an emerging field that holds great promise to make a significant impact in how we understand structural dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Since then, measurement and control of the subcycle field evolution of few-cycle light have opened the door to a radically new approach to exploring and controlling processes of the microcosm. The hyperfast-varying electric field of visible light permitted manipulation and tracking of the atomic-scale motion of electrons. Striking implications include controlled generation and measurement of single attosecond pulses of extreme ultraviolet light as well as trains of them, and real-time observation of atomic-scale electron dynamics. The tools and techniques for steering and tracing electronic motion in atoms, molecules, and nanostructures are now becoming available, marking the birth of attosecond physics.

In two of the schemes we find that although the number of scattering events is small with realistic laser parameters, measurement could be possible with an accumulation of a large number of laser shots. In the two other schemes a large number of scattering events is possible, however, the use of large future laser systems will be necessary. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per {\AA}2 with X-rays of 12keV energy or 1 {\AA} wavelength) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times. Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein molecules and small assemblies. Estimations of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that experiments using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample. We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural determinations with X- rays.},

Numerical solutions are given for the two-dimensional axisymmetric case for both initially homogeneous plasmas and static preformed plasma columns. These solutions account for (i) diffraction, (ii) refraction arising from variations in the refractive index due to the spatial profile of the electron density distribution, (iii) the relativistic electronic mass shift, and (iv) the charge displacement resulting from the transverse ponderomotive force. The most important spatial modes of propagation corresponding to (1) purely relativistic focusing and (2) the combined action of both the relativistic and charge-displacement mechanisms are described. The latter leads to the formation of stable confined modes of propagation having paraxially localized regions of high intensity and corresponding paraxially situated cavitated channels in the electron density. It is further demonstrated that the dynamical solutions of the propagation tend asymptotically to the lowest eigenmodes of the governing nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. Finally, the calculations illustrate the dynamics of the propagation and show that the relativistic mechanism promotes the initial concentration of the radiative energy and that the subsequent charge displacement stabilizes this confinement and produces waveguidelike channels. {\textcopyright} 1992 The American Physical Society.},

In the case of a sharp-boundary plasma, part of the energy of the laser pulse is found to be converted into a localized, relativistically strong, nonlinear electromagnetic pulse propagating into the plasma. The expansion of the hot electron cloud into the vacuum region and the action of the ponderomotive force of the laser pulse in the localized longitudinal electric field of the Langmuir oscillations lead to ion acceleration.

abstract = {Interaction of a high-power laser pulse having a sharp front with a thin plasma layer is considered. General one-dimensional numerical-analytical model is elaborated, in which the plasma layer is represented as a large collection of electron sheets, and a radiation reaction force is derived analytically. Using this model, trajectories of the electrons of the plasma layer are calculated numerically and compared with the electron trajectories obtained in particle-in-cell simulations, and a good agreement is found. Two simplified analytical models are considered, in which only one electron sheet is used, and it moves transversely and longitudinally in the fields of an ion sheet and a laser pulse (longitudinal displacements along the laser beam axis can be considerably larger than the laser wavelength). In the model I, a radiation reaction is included self-consistently, while in the model II a radiation reaction force is omitted. For the two models, analytical solutions for the dynamical parameters of the electron sheet in a linearly polarized laser pulse are derived and compared with the numerical solutions for the central electron sheet (positioned initially in the center) of the real plasma layer, which are calculated from the general numerical-analytical model. This comparison shows that the model II gives better description for the trajectory of the central electron sheet of the real plasma layer, while the model I gives more adequate description for a transverse momentum. Both models show that if the intensity of the laser pulse is high enough, even in the field with a constant amplitude, the electrons undergo not only the transverse oscillations with the period of the laser field, but also large (in comparison with the laser wavelength) longitudinal oscillations with the period, defined by the system parameters and initial conditions of particular oscillation. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

Moreover, it is expected they may soon be able to produce bursts of electrons shorter than those produced by conventional particle accelerators, down to femtosecond durations and less. Here we present wide-band spectral measurements of coherent transition radiation which we use for temporal characterization.

Singularities in multi-stream flows of emitting media cause constructive interference of emitted travelling waves, forming extremely localized sources of bright coherent emission. Here we for the first time demonstrate this extreme localization of BISER by direct observation of nano-scale coherent x-ray sources in a laser plasma. The energy emitted into the spectral range from 60 to 100 eV is up to $\sim$100 nJ, corresponding to $\sim$1010 photons. Simulations reveal that these sources emit trains of attosecond x-ray pulses. Our findings establish a new class of bright laboratory sources of electromagnetic radiation. Furthermore, being applicable to travelling waves of any nature (e.g. electromagnetic, gravitational or acoustic), BISER provides a novel framework for creating new emitters and for interpreting observations in many fields of science.},

Scaling these accelerators to the nanocoulomb range would yield hundreds of kiloamperes peak current and stimulate the next generation of radiation sources covering high-field THz, high-brightness X-ray and $\gamma$-ray sources, compact free-electron lasers and laboratory-size beam-driven plasma accelerators. However, accelerators generating such currents operate in the beam loading regime where the accelerating field is strongly modified by the self-fields of the injected bunch, potentially deteriorating key beam parameters. Here we demonstrate that, if appropriately controlled, the beam loading effect can be employed to improve the accelerator's performance. Self-Truncated ionization injection enables loading of unprecedented charges of {\^{a}}=0.5 nC within a mono-energetic peak. As the energy balance is reached, we show that the accelerator operates at the theoretically predicted optimal loading condition and the final energy spread is minimized.},

Based on radiation from electrons accelerated in plasma, these sources have the common properties to be compact and to deliver collimated, incoherent, and femtosecond radiation. In this article, within a unified formalism, the betatron radiation of trapped and accelerated electrons in the so-called bubble regime, the synchrotron radiation of laser-accelerated electrons in usual meter-scale undulators, the nonlinear Thomson scattering from relativistic electrons oscillating in an intense laser field, and the Thomson backscattered radiation of a laser beam by laser-accelerated electrons are reviewed. The underlying physics is presented using ideal models, the relevant parameters are defined, and analytical expressions providing the features of the sources are given. Numerical simulations and a summary of recent experimental results on the different mechanisms are also presented. Each section ends with the foreseen development of each scheme. Finally, one of the most promising applications of laser-plasma accelerators is discussed: the realization of a compact free-electron laser in the x-ray range of the spectrum. In the conclusion, the relevant parameters characterizing each sources are summarized. Considering typical laser-plasma interaction parameters obtained with currently available lasers, examples of the source features are given. The sources are then compared to each other in order to define their field of applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

To date, the investigations have remained mostly theoretical since it is almost impossible to settle this paradox through direct astrophysical black hole observations. Here, we point out that relativistic plasma mirrors can be accelerated drastically and stopped abruptly by impinging intense x-ray pulses on solid plasma targets with a density gradient. This is analogous to the late time evolution of black hole Hawking evaporation. A conception of such an experiment is proposed and a self-consistent set of physical parameters is presented. Critical issues, such as how the black hole unitarity may be preserved, can be addressed through the entanglement between the analog Hawking radiation photons and their partner modes.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that laser light can be upshifted to higher frequencies by its reflection off relativistically moving mirrors in plasma. These mirrors were generated with ultra-high intensity laser pulses. However, the laser light which was reflected off the mirrors had relatively low intensity. We show via simulations that even high intensity light can be reflected off the mirrors and that this can generate relativistically upshifted harmonics.},

abstract = {A method to generate ultrahigh intense electromagnetic fields is suggested, based on the laser pulse compression, carrier frequency upshift, and focusing by a counterpropagating breaking plasma wave, relativistic flying parabolic mirror. This method allows us to achieve the quantum electrodynamics critical field (Schwinger limit) with present-day laser systems. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Ohkubo2007,
abstract = {Pulse length of quasimonoenergetic electrons accelerated by the wakefield generated by 12 TW, 40 fs laser pulses in a gas jet is determined via spectral measurements using a bolometer to detect coherent transition radiation. A quasimonoenergetic electron beam with its mean energy E=21MeV, dispersion $\Delta$E=4MeV, total charge q∼30pC, and the geometrical emittance 0.07$\pi$mmmrad is generated with high reproducibility. The averaged duration of only the quasimonoenergetic electron bunches peaked around 20 MeV is 130±30fs (FWHM), while it is 250±70fs (FWHM) for electron bunches with quasimonoenergetic distributions peaked around 4 MeV, at a distance of 180 mm far from the gas jet because of relatively large electron energy spread. Pulse elongation of the electron bunch with the quasimonoenergetic distribution after 180 mm path is 60-220fs (FWHM). Therefore, the initial duration of the electron bunch at the gas-jet rear is expected to be less than 100 fs (FWHM). {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},
